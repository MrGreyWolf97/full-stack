A postback request is a term used in web development to describe the process where a web page sends a request to the same page on the server.

This is commonly seen in server-side scripting languages like [ASP.NET](http://asp.net/) and PHP.

In the context of a web application, when a user interacts with the web page (for example, by clicking a button or submitting a form), the browser sends a request back to the server.

This request is called a postback.

The server then processes this request, which may involve reading or updating data, and sends a response back to the client. The web page is then reloaded with the updated data.

This process allows the server to maintain the state of the web page across multiple requests, which is important in dynamic web applications where the user's actions can change the state of the application.
