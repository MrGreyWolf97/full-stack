# Differences: Java - Other languages

- **Platform independence**: Java is designed to be platform-independent through the use of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The JVM allows Java code to be compiled into bytecode, which can then be executed on any platform with a compatible JVM.
This is in contrast to languages like C++ or C, which are compiled to native machine code specific to a platform.
- **Object-oriented**: Java is an object-oriented programming language that supports inheritance, encapsulation, abstraction, and polymorphism.
While other languages like C++ also support object-oriented programming, some languages like C do not.

- **Memory management**: Java has automatic memory management through garbage collection, which frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer in use. This differs from languages like C and C++, where developers are responsible for manual memory management.
- **Syntax**: Java's syntax is similar to C++ but omits some of the more complex features, such as pointers and multiple inheritance (through classes). This makes Java relatively easier to learn and work with compared to C++.
- **Standard library**: Java comes with an extensive standard library (Java API) that provides a wide range of functionality, including data structures, I/O, networking, and concurrency support. While other languages also have standard libraries, the Java API is known for its comprehensiveness and ease of use.
