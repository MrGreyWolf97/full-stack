# Memory leak

A memory leak in Java occurs when an application unintentionally retains memory that it no longer needs, preventing the garbage collector from reclaiming that memory.

As a result, the application's memory usage keeps growing over time, leading to degraded performance and, eventually, crashes or out-of-memory errors.

Memory leaks in Java are typically caused by objects that are still reachable even though they are no longer required by the application.

## Common causes

### Static fields and collections

When objects are stored in static fields or collections, they remain in memory as long as the class is loaded. If these objects are not explicitly removed or nulled when they are no longer needed, they will cause memory leaks.

### Unclosed resources

Failing to close resources such as file streams, sockets, or database connections can lead to memory leaks, as the underlying native resources may not be released until the application terminates.

### Event listeners

If an object registers as a listener for events from another object but does not unregister itself when it is no longer needed, it will prevent the garbage collector from reclaiming the memory used by the listener object.

### Thread-local variables

When using thread-local variables, it is important to ensure that their values are removed when they are no longer needed, as they can cause memory leaks if threads are reused in thread pools.

### Caching and object pools

While caching and object pools can improve performance, they can also cause memory leaks if objects are not properly managed or evicted when they are no longer needed.

- using try-with-resources for handling resources
- unregistering event listeners
- carefully managing static fields and collections

When you suspect a memory leak, you can use tools like VisualVM, Eclipse Memory Analyzer, or Java Flight Recorder to analyze heap dumps and find the root cause of the leak.
