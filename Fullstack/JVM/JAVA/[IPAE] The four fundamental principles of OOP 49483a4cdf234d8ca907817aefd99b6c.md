# [IPAE] The four fundamental principles of OOP

- ***Inheritance***: Inheritance is the mechanism by which a class can inherit properties and methods from a "parent" class (also called superclass or base class).
This principle allows for code reuse and a hierarchical structure of classes.

- ***Polymorphism***: Polymorphism refers to the ability of an object to take on many forms.
**In OOP (and Java)**, polymorphism allows ***treating objects of derived classes as objects of the base class***, enabling the use of a common interface.

- ***Abstraction***: Abstraction is the process of simplifying a complex problem by focusing only on the essential aspects and hiding the non-essential details.
In **OOP** (and Java), abstraction is achieved through ***the use of abstract classes and interfaces, which allow defining contracts without providing a complete implementation***.

- ***Encapsulation***: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, *the object*.
This principle hides the internal implementation details and protects the object's state by exposing only a public interface.

However, some people use the acronym "IPAE" or "PAEI" to represent these four fundamental principles of object-oriented programming.
Keep in mind that this acronym is informal and not widely used in official documentation or textbooks.
