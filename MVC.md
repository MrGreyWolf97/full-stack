Model-View-Controller (MVC)  MVC is a design pattern often used in web development frameworks.

---

The pattern is divided into three interconnected components

### Model

The Model represents the data and the business logic of the application.

It is responsible for retrieving data and converting it into meaningful concepts for the application.

This could involve communicating with a database, processing data, or performing calculations.

### View

The View is the user interface of the application.

It displays the data to the user and allows them to interact with it.

The view gets its data from the model and does not have any knowledge about the business logic.

### Controller

The Controller acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View.

It processes user input from the view, updates the model accordingly, and then updates the view to reflect any changes in the model.

### Separation of concerns

The main advantage of the MVC pattern is the separation of concerns, which means that each component has a specific responsibility.

This makes the application easier to develop, test, and maintain.

For example, changes to the user interface (View) should not affect how data is processed (Model), and vice versa. 

Here's a simple example of how the MVC pattern might be used in a **Spring Boot** application:

```java
// Model
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    // getters and setters...
}

// Controller
@Controller
public class UserController {
    private final UserRepository userRepository;

    public UserController(UserRepository userRepository) {
        this.userRepository = userRepository;
    }

    @GetMapping("/users")
    public String listUsers(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("users", userRepository.findAll());
        return "users";
    }
}
```

In this example, User is the Model, UserController is the Controller, and users is the View (a Thymeleaf or JSP template, for example).

The Controller uses the UserRepository to retrieve all users from the database and adds them to the Model, which is then passed to the View for rendering.
