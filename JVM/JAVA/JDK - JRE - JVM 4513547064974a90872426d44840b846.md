# JDK - JRE - JVM

- ***JDK*** (Java Development Kit): The JDK is a **software package** that contains the tools and libraries needed for developing Java applications.
It includes:
    - the Java compiler (javac)
    - the Java runtime environment (JRE)
    - other development tools
- ***JRE*** (Java Runtime Environment): The JRE is a **software package** that provides the minimum requirements for running Java applications.
It includes:
    - the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
    - the core Java libraries (Java API) needed to execute Java bytecode.
    
    The JRE does not include development tools, such as the compiler, which are included in the JDK.
    
- ***JVM*** (Java Virtual Machine): The JVM is a virtual machine that interprets and executes Java bytecode on a specific platform.
The JVM is responsible for:
    - platform independence
    - memory management (garbage collection)
    - and enforcing the Java security model.
    
    The JVM is a core component of both the JDK and the JRE.
