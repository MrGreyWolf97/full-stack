# Thread starvation

Thread starvation is a situation in a multithreaded program where a thread is unable to make progress or execute its tasks because it cannot acquire the necessary resources, such as CPU time or a lock on a shared object.

Starvation often occurs when:

- **low-priority threads** are not given a chance to run because higher-priority threads are consuming all available resources
- ***unfair* lock acquisition** leads to some threads being repeatedly denied access to a shared resource.

### Best practices

1. Fairness: When using locks, such as `ReentrantLock` in Java, you can enforce fairness in lock acquisition by setting the fairness policy to `true`. Fair locks ensure that the longest-waiting thread will be granted access to the locked resource, reducing the risk of starvation.
However, fair locks may have lower performance compared to non-fair locks.
    
    ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;
    
    ReentrantLock fairLock = new ReentrantLock(true); // Create a fair lock
    ```
    
2. Thread priorities: Be cautious when assigning thread priorities, as excessive use of high-priority threads can lead to starvation for low-priority threads.
Use priorities judiciously and consider assigning equal priorities to threads that perform similar tasks, allowing the operating system to schedule them fairly.
3. Use higher-level synchronization constructs: Prefer using higher-level synchronization constructs from the `java.util.concurrent` package, such as `ExecutorService`, `Semaphore`, or `CountDownLatch`.
These constructs often provide built-in fairness and load-balancing mechanisms, helping to prevent starvation.
4. Limit the number of concurrent threads: Limit the number of threads that can access a shared resource concurrently using constructs like `Semaphore` or by controlling the thread pool size in an `ExecutorService`.
By limiting concurrency, you can help ensure that all threads have a chance to acquire the shared resource.
5. Timeouts and backoff strategies: Implement timeouts and backoff strategies in your synchronization logic, so that threads that are unable to acquire a shared resource within a certain time can release other resources and try again later.
This approach can help reduce contention and provide opportunities for other threads to make progress.
6. Monitor and analyze performance: Regularly monitor and analyze the performance of your multithreaded application to identify potential starvation issues.
    
    Tools like Java VisualVM, Java Mission Control, or other profiling tools can help you spot thread starvation and diagnose the underlying causes.
